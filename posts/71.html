            This is the first post on my new blogging engine, Quill. I'm going to be continuously working on this project to make it even better. I have a bunch of plans for this platform and once they are mostly built I plan to open source it and allow anyone to make a blog with Quill. I will soon be posting a blog post outlining the making of Quill.
